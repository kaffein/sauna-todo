# Sauna-todo

Simple full-stack Clojure TODO app example for TiTe and Luuppi -sauna.

## Development

Open terminal, go to the working directory and run:

```bash
lein dev
```

Then open your IDE / editor and start a new REPL from there. Use ```(reset)```
to start the server and reset it when you make changes to the backend.

The frontend will update automatically when files are saved.

## Deployment

Open terminal, go to the working directory and run:

```bash
lein prod
```

This will produce an uberjar, which you run with command:

```bash
java -jar target/uberjar/sauna-todo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```
